  "readme": "# Google Firebase Cloud Messaging Cordova Push Plugin\n> Extremely easy plug&play push notification plugin for Cordova applications with Google Firebase FCM.\n\n>[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VF654BMGUPQTJ)\n\n#### Version 2.1.1 (18/01/2017)\n- Tested on Android and iOS using Cordova cli 6.4.0, Cordova android 6.0.0 and Cordova ios 4.3.1\n- Available sdk functions: onTokenRefresh, getToken, subscribeToTopic, unsubscribeFromTopic and onNotification\n- 'google-services.json' and 'GoogleService-Info.plist' are added automatically from Cordova project root to platform folders\n- Added data payload parameter to check whether the user tapped on the notification or was received while in foreground.\n- **Free testing server available for free! https://cordova-plugin-fcm.appspot.com**\n\n##Installation\nMake sure you have ‘google-services.json’ for Android or  ‘GoogleService-Info.plist’ for iOS in your Cordova project root folder. You don´t need to configure anything else in order to have push notification working for both platforms, everything is magic.\n```Bash\ncordova plugin add cordova-plugin-fcm\n\n```\n\n#### Firebase configuration files\nGet the needed configuration files for Android or iOS from the Firebase Console (see docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/).\n\n#### Android compilation details\nPut the downloaded file 'google-services.json' in the Cordova project root folder.\n\nYou will need to ensure that you have installed the appropiate Android SDK libraries.\n\n\n:warning: For Android >5.0 status bar icon, you must include transparent solid color icon with name 'fcm_push_icon.png' in the 'res' folder in the same way you add the other application icons.\nIf you do not set this resource, then the SDK will use the default icon for your app which may not meet the standards for Android >5.0.\n\n#### iOS compilation details\nPut the downloaded file 'GoogleService-Info.plist' in the Cordova project root folder.\n\n##Usage\n\n:warning: It's highly recommended to use REST API to send push notifications because Firebase console does not have all the functionalities. **Pay attention to the payload example in order to use the plugin properly**.  \nYou can also test your notifications with the free testing server: https://cordova-plugin-fcm.appspot.com\n\n####Receiving Token Refresh\n\n```javascript\n//FCMPlugin.onTokenRefresh( onTokenRefreshCallback(token) );\n//Note that this callback will be fired everytime a new token is generated, including the first time.\nFCMPlugin.onTokenRefresh(function(token){\n    alert( token );\n});\n```\n\n####Get token\n\n```javascript\n//FCMPlugin.getToken( successCallback(token), errorCallback(err) );\n//Keep in mind the function will return null if the token has not been established yet.\nFCMPlugin.getToken(function(token){\n    alert(token);\n});\n```\n\n####Subscribe to topic\n\n```javascript\n//FCMPlugin.subscribeToTopic( topic, successCallback(msg), errorCallback(err) );\n//All devices are subscribed automatically to 'all' and 'ios' or 'android' topic respectively.\n//Must match the following regular expression: \"[a-zA-Z0-9-_.~%]{1,900}\".\nFCMPlugin.subscribeToTopic('topicExample');\n```\n\n####Unsubscribe from topic\n\n```javascript\n//FCMPlugin.unsubscribeFromTopic( topic, successCallback(msg), errorCallback(err) );\nFCMPlugin.unsubscribeFromTopic('topicExample');\n```\n\n####Receiving push notification data\n\n```javascript\n//FCMPlugin.onNotification( onNotificationCallback(data), successCallback(msg), errorCallback(err) )\n//Here you define your application behaviour based on the notification data.\nFCMPlugin.onNotification(function(data){\n    if(data.wasTapped){\n      //Notification was received on device tray and tapped by the user.\n      alert( JSON.stringify(data) );\n    }else{\n      //Notification was received in foreground. Maybe the user needs to be notified.\n      alert( JSON.stringify(data) );\n    }\n});\n```\n\n####Send notification. Payload example (REST API)\nFull documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref  \nFree testing server: https://cordova-plugin-fcm.appspot.com\n```javascript\n//POST: https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send\n//HEADER: Content-Type: application/json\n//HEADER: Authorization: key=AIzaSy*******************\n{\n  \"notification\":{\n    \"title\":\"Notification title\",\n    \"body\":\"Notification body\",\n    \"sound\":\"default\",\n    \"click_action\":\"FCM_PLUGIN_ACTIVITY\",\n    \"icon\":\"fcm_push_icon\"\n  },\n  \"data\":{\n    \"param1\":\"value1\",\n    \"param2\":\"value2\"\n  },\n    \"to\":\"/topics/topicExample\",\n    \"priority\":\"high\",\n    \"restricted_package_name\":\"\"\n}\n//sound: optional field if you want sound with the notification\n//click_action: must be present with the specified value for Android\n//icon: white icon resource name for Android >5.0\n//data: put any \"param\":\"value\" and retreive them in the JavaScript notification callback\n//to: device token or /topic/topicExample\n//priority: must be set to \"high\" for delivering notifications on closed iOS apps\n//restricted_package_name: optional field if you want to send only to a restricted app package (i.e: com.myapp.test)\n```\n##How it works\nSend a push notification to a single device or topic.\n- 1.a Application is in foreground:\n - The notification data is received in the JavaScript callback without notification bar message (this is the normal behaviour of mobile push notifications).\n- 1.b Application is in background or closed:\n - The device displays the notification message in the device notification bar.\n - If the user taps the notification, the application comes to foreground and the notification data is received in the JavaScript callback.\n - If the user does not tap the notification but opens the applicacion, nothing happens until the notification is tapped.\n\n\n##License\n```\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Felipe Echanique Torres (felipe.echanique in the gmail.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
